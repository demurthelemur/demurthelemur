### Hello I am Demir, aka DemurTheLemur 👋
- I am currently studying at Sabancı University to get my degree in Computer Sciences and Engineering👨🏻‍💻
- I am mostly interested in Mobile Development. I mainly do Native IOS Development but I am familiar with Flutter for cross platform apps.
- I am also interested in Web Development but web development is in the back-burner.
- The languages that I am most comfortable with are (in order of most to least) Swift, Javascript, C++, Python, C, Dart. 
- Although I don't have much knowledge on these fields I am also interested in Hardware, Programming language development, OS development and other low level stuff. I hope to get more knowledge in these fields as time goes on.
- I am kind of an apple fanboy and am interested in everything apple related.
- Other than coding I am interested in Cooking, Photography, Drawing and other kinds of Visual Arts.
- Feel free to reach me out on my twitter @DemirDereli1 or email workdemirdereli@gmail.com
- Intern at Rapsodo
